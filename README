Spec
----------
Parse through a web access log file and capture browser counts

Usage
----------
php runLogAnalysis.php <path_to_log_file>

Returns a CSV formatted report of browsers and counts in log file;

Considerations
----------
I used a cursor based file read and looped over each line because I don't know how big the log file is going to be, and I didn't want run into memory issues.
